### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my GitHub repository, where you can have a look at the projects I've been working on.
I am a Graduate from the University of Auckland, Majoring in Computer Science and Information Systems. I am currently pursuing my Honours degree in Computer Science at the University of Auckland
I love problem solving and programming, which is what lead to my interest in the development field of work. I am also good at coming up with creative solutions and work well in a team.
